# Counter

Counter is an example program written with [BarnabasBox](https://github.com/nmke-de/BarnabasBox). It allows you to increment and decrement a number displayed on the screen and change its base within the range of natural numbers from 2 to 16.

## But why?

This is a demonstration of BarnabasBox usage and mainly serves as such. There are probably better ways to calculate the same number in a different base.

## Dependencies

- BarnabasBox (duh.)
	- Dependencies of BarnabasBox.

## Build
